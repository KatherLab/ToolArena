test_invocations:
  # Below, we define test invocations for the task.
  # Each test invocation is a dictionary with the keys "name", "arguments", and "mount", like the example invocation above (with the addition of the "name" key).
  # The test invocations can be used in the unit tests to check that the task is working as expected.
  # Below, we define 3 test invocations for the task, named "tif", "png", and "jpg". 
  # It is recommended that you define at least 3 test invocations (of course, you can choose any names you want).
