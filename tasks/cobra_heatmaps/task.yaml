description: Create unsupervised heatmaps using COBRA. The provided tile features have 1.0 mpp (224 microns / 224 px per patch).  # Description of the task. This should be 1-3 sentences in length, explaining to the LLM what this tool should do.

  mount:
    # In this section, you can specify files or folders that should be mounted from the data directory to the container (at "/mount/input" in the container).
    # Each mount is a dictionary with the keys "source" and "target", where "source" is the path to the file or folder in the data directory and "target" is the path to the file or folder in the container.
    # For example, the following line mounts the file "TUM-TCGA-ACRLPPQE.tif" from the data directory to the container, placing it at the path "/mount/input/TUM-TCGA-ACRLPPQE.tif" in the container.

test_invocations:
  # Below, we define test invocations for the task.
  # Each test invocation is a dictionary with the keys "name", "arguments", and "mount", like the example invocation above (with the addition of the "name" key).
  # The test invocations can be used in the unit tests to check that the task is working as expected.
  # Below, we define 3 test invocations for the task, named "tif", "png", and "jpg". 
  # It is recommended that you define at least 3 test invocations (of course, you can choose any names you want).
